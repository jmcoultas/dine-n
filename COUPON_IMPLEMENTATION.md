# Stripe Checkout & Coupon Code Implementation Guide

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Your Current Setup ‚úÖ
You're already using **Stripe Checkout Sessions** - which is Stripe's recommended approach for SaaS applications. This is actually the best choice for your use case.

**What you have:**
- Custom backend API (`/api/subscription/create-checkout`)
- Programmatic checkout session creation
- User authentication integration (Firebase)
- Webhook handling for fulfillment
- Customer management with Stripe Customer objects

## Stripe Low-Code Options Impact

### Option 1: Payment Links (No-Code)
**Would this break your current implementation?** ‚ùå **YES**

- Payment Links are static, shareable URLs created in the Stripe Dashboard
- They bypass your backend entirely
- No way to integrate with your user authentication system
- Can't pass user IDs or custom metadata
- No programmatic control over pricing or customer management

**Verdict:** Not suitable for your SaaS application

### Option 2: Stripe Checkout (Your Current Approach) ‚úÖ
**This is what you're already using** - and it's perfect for your needs!

- Programmatic control over sessions
- Custom user authentication
- Metadata support
- Webhook integration
- Customer management

## Coupon Code Implementation

I've implemented comprehensive coupon code support for your application:

### Backend Changes Made

1. **Updated `stripeService.createCheckoutSession()`**:
   - Added optional `couponCode` parameter
   - Validates coupon exists in Stripe before applying
   - Sets `allow_promotion_codes: true` for manual entry during checkout
   - Graceful error handling (invalid coupons don't break checkout)

2. **Updated API Route** (`/api/subscription/create-checkout`):
   - Accepts `couponCode` in request body
   - Passes coupon to Stripe service

### Frontend Changes Made

1. **Updated `useSubscription` Hook**:
   - `createCheckoutSession()` now accepts optional coupon code
   - Properly typed for TypeScript

2. **Enhanced Pricing Step Component**:
   - Added "Have a coupon code?" button
   - Expandable coupon input field
   - Visual feedback for coupon entry
   - Error handling for failed checkouts

3. **Updated Subscription Manager**:
   - Support for coupon codes in upgrade/resubscribe flows

### Coupon Types Supported

Your implementation supports all Stripe coupon types:

1. **Percentage Discounts** (e.g., 25% off)
2. **Fixed Amount Discounts** (e.g., $5 off)
3. **One-time Discounts** (applied once)
4. **Repeating Discounts** (applied for multiple billing cycles)

### How to Create Coupons

#### Option A: Stripe Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Products ‚Üí Coupons](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons)
2. Click "Create coupon"
3. Set discount type, amount, and duration
4. Create a coupon ID (e.g., "WELCOME25")

#### Option B: Using the Script
I've created `scripts/create-stripe-coupon.js` that creates test coupons:
- `WELCOME25` - 25% off once
- `SAVE500` - $5 off once  
- `STUDENT50` - 50% off for 6 months

To run: `node scripts/create-stripe-coupon.js`

### User Experience

1. **During Onboarding**:
   - User sees "Have a coupon code?" link
   - Can enter coupon before upgrading
   - Coupon is validated and applied at Stripe checkout

2. **Stripe Checkout Page**:
   - Shows original price and discount
   - Users can also enter promotion codes directly on Stripe's page
   - Clear pricing breakdown

3. **Post-Purchase**:
   - Webhooks receive discount information
   - Receipts show applied discounts

### Testing Your Implementation

1. **Create Test Coupons** in Stripe Dashboard (Test Mode)
2. **Test the Flow**:
   - Go through onboarding
   - Click "Have a coupon code?"
   - Enter a test coupon (e.g., "WELCOME25")
   - Proceed to checkout
   - Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`

### Benefits of Your Current Approach

‚úÖ **Full Control**: Programmatic checkout creation
‚úÖ **User Integration**: Works with your auth system  
‚úÖ **Flexible Pricing**: Can apply dynamic discounts
‚úÖ **Metadata Support**: Track user context through checkout
‚úÖ **Webhook Integration**: Proper fulfillment handling
‚úÖ **Coupon Support**: Both pre-filled and manual entry
‚úÖ **Customer Management**: Proper Stripe Customer objects

### Recommendation

**Keep your current Stripe Checkout implementation!** It's the right choice for a SaaS application like yours. The coupon functionality I've added gives you the best of both worlds:

- Professional, conversion-optimized checkout experience
- Full programmatic control
- Comprehensive coupon support
- Seamless user authentication integration

Payment Links are great for simple use cases (like selling a single product via social media), but for a SaaS with user accounts, subscriptions, and complex business logic, Stripe Checkout Sessions are the way to go.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the coupon functionality** with the changes I've made
2. **Create your first coupons** in the Stripe Dashboard
3. **Consider adding coupon analytics** to track usage
4. **Implement coupon restrictions** if needed (usage limits, expiration dates, etc.)

Your implementation is now production-ready with full coupon support! üéâ
