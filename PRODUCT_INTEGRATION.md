# Stripe Product Integration Guide

## Overview

Your subscription system has been updated to tie subscriptions to a specific product in your Stripe Dashboard (`prod_SncR91waZDrn6E`). This provides better organization, reporting, and management of your subscription offerings.

## What Changed

### Before (Dynamic Price Data)
- Subscriptions were created with inline `price_data`
- No connection to Stripe Dashboard products
- Pricing was hardcoded in the application

### After (Product Integration)
- Subscriptions are tied to a specific Stripe product
- Uses proper Price objects from Stripe Dashboard
- Centralized product management
- Better analytics and reporting

## Configuration Options

### Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)
The system will automatically:
1. Check if your product (`prod_SncR91waZDrn6E`) has a suitable $9.99/month price
2. Create one if it doesn't exist
3. Use that price for all subscriptions

**No configuration needed** - this works out of the box!

### Option 2: Specific Price ID (Advanced)
If you want to use a specific price ID, set the environment variable:

```bash
STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_1234567890abcdef
```

In Replit: Go to Secrets tab and add `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` with your price ID.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Setup Script
```bash
node scripts/setup-product-integration.js
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Verify your product exists
- üîç Check for existing suitable prices
- üÜï Create a $9.99/month price if needed
- üìã Show you exactly what to configure

### Step 2: Set Environment Variable (Optional)
If you want to use a specific price ID:
1. Go to Replit Secrets tab
2. Add `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` with the price ID from Step 1
3. Restart your application

### Step 3: Test the Integration
1. Go through your subscription flow
2. Check the Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Subscriptions
3. Verify the subscription is tied to your product

## File Changes Made

- Updated `createCheckoutSession()` to use product-based pricing
- Added product_id to subscription metadata

### `server/config/environment.ts`

### Scripts Added
- `scripts/setup-product-integration.js` - Complete setup automation
- `scripts/check-product-prices.js` - Check existing prices
- `scripts/create-product-price.js` - Create new price if needed

## How It Works

1. **Price Resolution**:
   ```
   STRIPE_PRICE_ID set? ‚Üí Use specific price ID
   ‚Üì No
   Check product for $9.99/month price ‚Üí Use existing price
   ‚Üì No suitable price found
   Create new $9.99/month price ‚Üí Use new price
   ```

2. **Subscription Creation**:
   ```
   User clicks upgrade ‚Üí Create checkout session
   ‚Üì
   Resolve price ID (see above)
   ‚Üì
   Create session with product-tied price
   ‚Üì
   Subscription tied to your product
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Product Not Found
```
‚ùå Product prod_SncR91waZDrn6E not found
```
**Solution**: Verify the product ID in your Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Products

### No Suitable Price
```
‚ö†Ô∏è No $9.99/month recurring price found
```
**Solution**: Run `node scripts/create-product-price.js` to create one

### Environment Variable Issues
```
‚ùå No Stripe secret key found
```
**Solution**: Ensure `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_DEV` or `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_PROD` is set in Replit Secrets

## Testing

### 1. Verify Configuration
```bash
node scripts/check-product-prices.js prod_SncR91waZDrn6E
```

### 2. Test Subscription Flow
1. Go through onboarding
2. Select premium plan
3. Complete checkout with test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`

### 3. Verify in Stripe Dashboard
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Subscriptions
2. Find your test subscription
3. Click on it and verify it shows your product name
4. Check that the line item references your product

## Migration Notes

### Existing Subscriptions
- Existing subscriptions will continue to work
- New subscriptions will use the product integration
- No impact on current customers

### Backwards Compatibility
- System falls back to price_data if product integration fails
- Existing coupon functionality preserved
- All webhook handling remains the same

## Next Steps

1. **Run the setup script** to get your price ID
2. **Set the environment variable** (optional but recommended)
3. **Test the integration** with a test subscription
4. **Monitor** the Stripe Dashboard for better insights

Your subscription system is now properly integrated with Stripe's product catalog! üéâ
