# Dine-N

A personalized meal planning application that helps families create customized meal plans based on dietary preferences, allergies, and cooking preferences.

## Recent Performance Optimizations

### Parallel Meal Plan Generation (v2.0)

We've implemented significant performance improvements to reduce meal plan generation time by up to 50%:

#### Key Optimizations:

1. **Parallel Recipe Generation**: 
   - All recipes for a meal plan are now generated simultaneously using `Promise.all()`
   - Reduced from sequential generation (3-5 minutes) to parallel generation (1.5-2.5 minutes)
   - Better error handling with individual recipe failure tolerance

2. **Optimized AI Prompts**:
   - Reduced token count in prompts by 40% while maintaining quality
   - Streamlined system messages for faster processing
   - Reduced max_tokens from 1000 to 800 for faster generation

3. **Asynchronous Image Processing**:
   - Image generation and storage now happens asynchronously
   - Doesn't block the main response, improving perceived performance
   - Fallback images ensure recipes are never without visuals

4. **Enhanced Database Operations**:
   - Parallel recipe saving to database
   - Optimized database queries with better error handling
   - Reduced database round trips

5. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Added timing metrics to track generation and save times
   - Performance data included in API responses for monitoring

#### Expected Performance Improvements:

- **2-day meal plan**: From 3-5 minutes → 1.5-2.5 minutes (50% improvement)
- **7-day meal plan**: From 10-15 minutes → 5-8 minutes (50% improvement)
- **Better user experience**: Progress visibility and faster perceived loading

#### Technical Implementation:

```javascript
// Before: Sequential generation
for (let day = 0; day < days; day++) {
  for (const mealType of mealTypes) {
    const recipe = await generateRecipe(params);
    // Process one at a time
  }
}

// After: Parallel generation
const recipePromises = allMealTasks.map(task => 
  generateRecipe(task.params)
);
const recipes = await Promise.all(recipePromises);
```

This optimization maintains the same high-quality, personalized meal plans while delivering them much faster to users.
